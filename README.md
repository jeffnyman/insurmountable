# Insurmountable Mission

This is an homage to the ["Impossible Mission"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_Mission) game developed by Epyx back in 1984.

I will basing some of this work on that done by [Krisztian Toth](http://krissz.hu/). The source code for his version is not available so I'm recreating what I can from a disassembly of one of the Commodore 64 ROM images of the game.
